/CSS to hide mobile toggle button for desktop device
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .btn-mobile-toggle {
        display: none;
    }

The most commonly used media queries are:

min-width Rules applied for any browser width over the value defined in the query
max-width Rules applied for any browser width below the value defined in the query
min-height Rules applied for any browser height over the value defined in the query
max-height Rules applied for any browser height below the value defined in the query
orientation:portrait Rules applied for any browser where the height is greater than or equal to the width
orientation:landscape Rules for any browser where the width is greater than the height

Note: There is an important difference between min-width and min-device-width.The value for min-width is based on the size of the browser window, while the value formin-device-width is based on the size of the display screen for the device.
